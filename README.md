# SynthV-Scripts
A collection of scripts for SynthV.

Add_breaths.js adds breaths in empty spaces before notes in the selected track.

Remove_breaths.js removes all breath notes in the selected track.

DoublePhoneme.js makes the strength of EN and JP consonants 20. Good for vocal doubles that you don't want to be too noticeable in the selected track.

Fix_V5_conversion.js fixes EN lyric errors that occur when converting a Vocaloid 5 project file to a SynthV project file in the selected track.

MaiPhoneme.js slightly de-esses the notes in the selected track.

ResetPhoneme.js makes all phonemes in the selected track have default strength and duration. Good for when you're updating your voicebank and realize that the old strength and duration adjustments don't work at all anymore.

SolariaPhonemeEN.js changes the phoneme length and strength of many specific phonemes. This script is specifically geared for use on Solaria 101.
